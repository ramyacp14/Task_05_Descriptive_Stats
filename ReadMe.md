## **Overview**
This repository contains a dataset (`womens_lacrosse_stats.csv`) and an analysis document (`LLM Doc with prompts and answers.docx`) for the Syracuse Women's Lacrosse team's performance in a recent season. The analysis includes 20 key questions about team performance, player statistics, and strategic insights, comparing manual answers with responses generated by an LLM (ChatGPT).

## **How to Use This Data**
1. **For Coaches/Analysts:**  
   - Identify top performers and areas for improvement (e.g., shooting efficiency, turnovers).  
   - Compare player contributions (e.g., `PTS/GP` for starters vs. bench).  
   - Simulate scenarios (e.g., impact of a 10% shooting percentage increase).  

2. **For Researchers:**  
   - Study correlations (e.g., shots vs. goals: `r = 0.99`).  
   - Test LLM accuracy in sports analytics by replicating prompts.  

3. **For Students:**  
   - Practice data cleaning (e.g., handling duplicate entries like "Peers, Ava").  
   - Explore statistical metrics (e.g., `GB/TO ratio` for possession analysis).

## **Notes**
- **Data Limitations:**  
  - No game-by-game trends (aggregate stats only).  
  - Small sample sizes for some players (e.g., Olivia Adamson: 3 GP).  
- **LLM Challenges:**  
  - Required follow-up prompts for accuracy (e.g., "Double-check assists").  
  - Misinterpreted player names (e.g., "Ward, Emma" vs. "Beardsley, Angela").
